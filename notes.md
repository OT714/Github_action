At its core, GitOps is a set of best practices that enables software teams to manage their infrastructure and applications using Git as a single source of truth. This approach ensures that all changes to the codebase and infrastructure are version controlled, automated, and auditable.
One of the key benefits of GitOps is that it provides a consistent and repeatable way to manage infrastructure and applications, regardless of the underlying technology stack. This is particularly important in today's fast-paced software development environment, where teams are constantly working on new features and updates.
Another important aspect of GitOps is its focus on automation. By using tools like Git and Kubernetes, teams can automate the deployment and management of their applications, reducing the risk of human error and enabling faster release cycles.
Finally, GitOps also promotes collaboration between different teams within an organization, since all changes are tracked in a centralized location and can be easily reviewed and approved by team members.
